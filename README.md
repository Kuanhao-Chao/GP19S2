## Scientific calculator

### Task

A scientific calculator extends the functionality of a standard calculator. In general, a scientific calculator would support various complex functions and provide high-levels of machine precision for floating-point computation. Check out the HiPER Scientific Calculator or Desmos Graphing Calculator in the Google Play store to see how the advanced scientific calculator should look like.

**Default features**
* Scientific keyboard support (e.g. trigonometric functions, log/exp functions, etc)
* Parsing & execution equation with brackets e.g. (, {, [, ], }, )
* Equation editing (i.e. after computing a certain equation, one can modify the computed equation and recompute the result)
* Defining function (a defined function can be reused multiple times. i.e. define f(x,y) = 2x+3y then call f(1,2), f(2,3), …)
* Saving and loading equations/functions (i.e. one can reload the saved equation after restarting the app)

**Advanced feature**
* Function plots: a calculator plots the functions defined by a user.
